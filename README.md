# CodeClauseInternship
It's my CodeClause Internship project. My project is a Text editor that can do some tasks such as styling the selected text, changing the color, changing the size. 
It's my first developing an application, so it may seem little unorganized but next time around I will organize the stuff and try to create an advanced text editor.
